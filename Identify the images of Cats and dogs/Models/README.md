**Image Classification**

  

**GOAL**

  

Identifying the images of cats and dogs.Algorithm used for this purpose was CNN.

  

**DATASET**

 https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images

  

**DESCRIPTION**

  
The main aim of the project is to implement an algorithm which detects whether an image is cat or a dog.

  

**WORK DONE**

* Analyzed the dataset and it turns out to be a balanced one.
* Rescaled all the images and also applied different image augumentation technique on the training data.
* After applying augumentation defined an CNN architecture and train the model.
* Finally the testing data was predicted and the accuracy turns out to be around 85%.
  


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* tensorflow
* keras

**CONCLUSION**

  

The dataset was analysed and checked for class imbalance, then different image augumentation techniques were applied and CNN was used for the training purpose and an accuracy of around 85% was observed on the training dataset.
