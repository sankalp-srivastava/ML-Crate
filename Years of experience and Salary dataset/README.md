PROJECT TITLE

Predict Salary based on Years Of Experience

GOAL

Aim- To predict the salary of a person with the help of years of experience given

DATASET

DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem and to find the model with the best prediction 4 different algorithms are used

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. it starts with finding the dimensions of the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. checking if there are any null values present- no null values present
4. then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. data visualization is done with interactive plotly plots.
6. finally 4 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

MODELS USED

since this is a regression problem so regression algorithms are used-
1. Linear Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for regression problems
2. Lasso Regression= improved version of regularization with L1 regularization
3. Ridge REgression= improved version of regularization with L2 regularization
4. K Nearest Neighbours Regressor= 

LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Plotly
5. Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

1. Linear Regression= 98.81% accurate
2. Lasso Regression= 98.81% accurate
3. Ridge REgression= 97.20% accurate
4. K Nearest Neighbours Regressor= 97.35% accurate

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Linear & Lasso Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement
