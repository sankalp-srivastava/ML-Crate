# Pneumonia Disease Prediction


**GOAL**

The main idea of this project is to analyse the pneumonia disease and  comparing the current pneumonia infection rates over time with previous years. The Centers for Disease Control makes these data available on a weekly basis.

**DESCRIPTION**

From the website where the dataset is actually taken:

To protect Americans from serious disease, the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) helps public health monitor, control, and prevent about 120 diseases. These diseases are important to monitor nationwide and include infectious diseases such as Zika, foodborne outbreaks such as E. coli, and noninfectious conditions such as lead poisoning. About 3,000 public health departments gather and use data on these diseases to protect their local communities. Through NNDSS, CDC receives and uses these data to keep people healthy and defend America from health threats.

NNDSS is a multifaceted program that includes the surveillance system for collection, analysis, and sharing of health data. It also includes policies, laws, electronic messaging standards, people, partners, information systems, processes, and resources at the local, state, territorial, and national levels.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
1. Firstly, I have imported the required libraries such as sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and mpl toolkits.
2. I have defined the functions for the distribution graph such as bar and histogram.
3. I have defined the function for the correlation matrix. 
4. I have defined the function for the scatter and density plots. 
5. Imported the dataset. 
6. Had a glance of the first 5 rows of the data, using the head function. 
7. Visualised the histogram and bar graphs which helps to analyse the data of the pneumonia disease. 
8. Visualized the correlation matrix between weel and the year and observed that there is high correlation. 
9. Visualized the scatter and density plots. 

**MODELS USED**

I have worked on different types of visualtions such as:

1. histogram
2. bar graph
3. correlation matrix
4. scatter plot 
5. density plot

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1.  sklearn
2.  matplotlib
3.  numpy 
4.  pandas
5.  mpl toolkits

**CONCLUSION**

Made the visualizations that helps the people understand the various relations between the year and week and other columns such as the count and the probable count and so on. This helps the people analyse the Pneumonia Disease.
