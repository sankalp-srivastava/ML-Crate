# Lumpy Skin Disease Prediction

## GOAL
The goal of this project is to perform EDA and forecasting Lumpy Skin Disease occurrence based on meteorological and geospatial features.

## DATASET
The Dataset used for this project has been collected from kaggle website. The dataset contains Lumpy Skin Disease occurrence based on meteorological and geospatial features.

The data is available at :- https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/lumpy-skin-disease-dataset
## DESCRIPTION
This is a classification problem where we need to predict the Lumpy Skin Disease occurrence. I used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest to predict thee occurrence.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Performed EDA on the dataset
2. Visualized the data using countplot
3. Found correlation using heatmap.
4. Used 3 different models to predict the disease occurrence.
5. Calculated accuracy score of each algorithm to compare with other algorithms.

## MODEL USED

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Decision Tree

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn

## ACCURACIES

1. Logistic Regression :- 94.89315952156969
2. Random Forest :- 97.48689692245665
3. Decision Tree :- 97.1240424674103

## CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Random Forest gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
