[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again


[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

[Verse 3: J-Status]
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'


[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

[Outro: Rihanna]
Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever";2005;6000

Music of the Sun;The Last Time;"[Verse 1]
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true


[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Music of the Sun;There’s a Thug In My Life;"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud


[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

[Verse 3: J-Status]
T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be


[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

Music of the Sun;Now I Know;"[Verse 1]
Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Verse 2]
Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa


[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Bridge]
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It’s the way it’s gotta be

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do

A Girl Like Me;Final Goodbye;"[Verse 1]
I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Hold on me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside, the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

Promise you our love
Will carry on
Until you turn eternal
We belong


[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life

And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, mm

[Verse 1]
What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

[Chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
You, yeah, mm


[Verse 2]
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?

And I can hide the tears

It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

A Girl Like Me;Coulda Been the One;"[Verse 1]
Looking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know

[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby

[Verse 2]
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone


[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
Coulda been the one, baby
Coulda been the one

[Bridge]
You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone

[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy

You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank

When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better

And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend

If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend

Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest

So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)

But if you playing (Not with it)

Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)

So baby, why won't you (Say it)

Good Girl Gone Bad;Sell Me Candy;"[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)


[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 3]
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be

Good Girl Gone Bad;Rehab (Ft. Justin Timberlake);"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

Good Girl Gone Bad;Question Existing;"[Verse 1]
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Verse 2]
Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)

He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end

Good Girl Gone Bad;Cry;"[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole ""in love"" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry


[Verse 2]
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give it to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life

But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Verse 2]
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be

But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe

How can I fight with someone that I can't see?

My new nickname is ""You Idiot"" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this

Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak

Let go!
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rihanna]
All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild


[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
Baby might drown


[Pre-Chorus 2: Rihanna]
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got a hole in my head

Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody

I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)

Loud;Love the Way You Lie, Pt. II (Ft. Eminem);"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave

In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it


[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me

What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh

But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me

Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know


[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets


[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
