DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem and to find the model with the best prediction 3 different algorithms are used

WHAT I HAD DONE

perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
it starts with finding the dimensions of the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
checking if there are any null values present- no null values present
then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
data visualization is done with interactive plotly plots.
finally 4 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm
also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms
MODELS USED

since this is a regression problem so regression algorithms are used-

1. Decision Tree Regression= gives the highest accuracy

2. K Nearest Neighbors Regression= concept of proximity

3. Support Regression= concept of SVM


LIBRARIES NEEDED

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Plotly
Scikit-Learn
NLTK

ACCURACIES

Decision Tree= 73%
K Nearest Neighbors= 32%
Support Vector Machines= 18%


CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Decision Tree gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement
