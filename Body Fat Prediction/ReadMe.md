DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we need to predict the body fat of human. We use Linear, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. it starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. we calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

MODELS USED

1. Linear Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for classification problems
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Regression


LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

1. Linear Regression Score = 0.6353780797292594
2. Lasso Regression Score = 0.6952036136550136
3. Random Forest Regressor Score = 0.6704406440872133

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Lasso Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
