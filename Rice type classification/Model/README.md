# Rice type classification

## GOAL
The goal of this project is to perform EDA and predict the rice grain type using the dataset.

## DATASET
The dataset used for this project has been collected from kaggle website. The dataset contains specifications of rice grains. It contains data of Area, Axis lengths, Diameter, Perimeter and Grain type of rice.<br>
The data is available at :- https://www.kaggle.com/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification

## DESCRIPTION
This is a classification problem where we need to predict the rice grain type. I used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest to predict the grain type.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Performed EDA on the dataset
2. Visualized the data using countplot and
3. Found correlation using heatmap.
4. Used 3 different models to predict the grain type.
5. Calculated accuracy score of each algorithm to compare with other algorithms.

## MODEL USED

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Decision Tree

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn

## ACCURACIES

1. Logistic Regression :- 98.71700879765396
2. Random Forest :- 98.66202346041055
3. Decision Tree :- 98.09384164222874

## CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Logistic Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
