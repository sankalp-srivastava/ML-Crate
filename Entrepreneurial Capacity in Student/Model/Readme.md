### Entrepreneurial Capacity in Student
   **GOAL**
   ##### To Create a machine learning model with highest accuracy which will predict the Entrepreneurial Capacity in Student.
   **DATASET**
   ##### [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/namanmanchanda/entrepreneurial-competency-in-university-students)
   **DESCRIPTION**
   ##### Entrepreneurs have been shaping the world in every way possible. The dataset comprises 16 features collected from university students in India. The target variable consists whether the student is likely to become an entrepreneur or not. Hence, we need to classify the dataset into whether the student is likely to become an enterpreneur or not.
   **WHAT I HAD DONE**
   ##### 1. Imported libraries required
   ##### 2. Extracted data from kaggle
   ##### 3. Prepared dataset 
   ##### 4. Performed exploratory data analysis on updated data
   ##### 5. Split data for training and testing purpose
   ##### 6. Checked the accuracy of different algorithms. Comparing the accuracy scores among Logistic Regression , SVC, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, Random Forest Classifier had highest value.
   **MODELS USED**
   
   ##### SVC: The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit to the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data. 
   ##### Logistic Regression:  Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. 
   ##### Decision Tree Classifier:Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning
   ##### Random Forest Classifier: Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems.
   
  
   **LIBRARIES NEEDED**
   
   ##### Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
