## Conclusion and Insights:
### General Insights
- The dataset didn't have any missing values meaning no random values were taken into consideration.
- A few insights like from ```.describe()``` and ```.info()``` are there is minimum of around 18.5k Total IPC (Indian Penal Code) Crimes which is a very pathetic situation.
- In district name ```TOTAL``` is, the sum of all the number of cases reported that 
year.

### Insights for TN:
- Year 2000: Minimum Rape Cases 
- Year 2012: Maximum Rape Cases
- There has been a continuous increase in Rape Cases as year pass by.

### Overall Insights:
- Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamilnadu have recorded the most IPC Crimes between the years 2001-2012.
- Kidnapping and Riots contribute to majority of Crimes.
- Obviously, all States have more crimes compared to Union Territories.
