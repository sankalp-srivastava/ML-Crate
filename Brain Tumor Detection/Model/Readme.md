**Image Classification**

  

**GOAL**

  

Detecting brain tumor,algorithm used for this purpose was CNN.

  

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

  

**DESCRIPTION**

  
The main aim of the project is to create a ML model which will detect the presence of brain tumor

  

**WORK DONE**

* Analyzed the dataset and it turns out to be a balanced one.
* Rescaled all the images and also applied different image augumentation technique on the training data.
* After applying augumentation defined an CNN architecture and train the model.
* Two different architectures of CNN was used and the results were noted
  


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* tensorflow
* keras

**CONCLUSION**

  

The dataset was analysed and checked for class imbalance, then different image augumentation techniques were applied and CNN was used for the training purpose and an accuracy of around 97% was observed on the training dataset.
