### Project Title
Top Programming language in GitHub
### Aim
Create a model, which will classify the top programming language used in GitHub.
### Dataset

### Approach
After data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis, Using various data visualization techniques, the top languages based on issues, prs and repos were analyzed.
### Steps Involved
- Importing all libraries
- Using bar plot to analyze the top 15 languages based on number of repos
- Visualizing Number of Issues with Respect to Each Year
- Visualizing Total Number of PRs with respect to each Year
- Finding Top 15 Languages which has most number of Issues
- Finding Top 15 Languages which has most number of PRs
- Visualizing Issues of TOP 8 Languages in Github using Linplot
- Visualizing PRs of TOP 8 Languages in Github using Linplot
