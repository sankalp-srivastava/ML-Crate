**Image Classification**

  

**GOAL**

  

Identifying the images of different vegetables.Algorithm used for this purpose was CNN.

  

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset

  

**DESCRIPTION**

  
The main aim of the project is to create a ML model which will classify and recognize vegetables.

  

**WORK DONE**

* Analyzed the dataset and it turns out to be a balanced one.
* Rescaled all the images and also applied different image augumentation technique on the training data.
* After applying augumentation defined an CNN architecture and train the model.
* Finally the testing data was predicted and the accuracy turns out to be around 94%.
  


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* tensorflow
* keras
