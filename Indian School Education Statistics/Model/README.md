### Project Title
Indian School Education Statistics
### Aim
Analyse the Statistics for Indian Schools, includes GER, Water facility, Electricity, DR,etc
### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/vidyapb/indian-school-education-statistics
### Approach
After data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis, Using various data visualization techniques, the factors like GER, DR, Water facility, Electricity, Computer, Boys toilet, Girls toilet, were analyzed.
### Steps Involved
- Importing all libraries
- Using bar plot to analyze computers in vaious states
- Using Pie chat to analyze All Schools Percentage
- Using bar plot to visualize all levels of schools with respect to state
- Following same approach for Electricity, Computer, Boys Toilet, Girls Toilet
- Using histplot and pairplot to visualize Gross enrollment ratio
- Feature engineering is performed in Drop Out ratio.
- Correlation of all States-Yearwise with respect to all schools were analyzed using heat-map
